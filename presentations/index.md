  - title: Taming Data with Science
    description: >
      Information Entropy is a way of measuring data in terms of the amount of uncertainty it resolves.
      We'll use this perspective to explore techniques for structuring and analysing your data. You will learn
      practical ideas for how to extract more value from your data and leave with a framework for understanding
      the value proposition of data-driven products.
